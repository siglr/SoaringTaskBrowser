SoaringTaskBrowser is a web application designed to provide a web browser for gliding tasks for Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS).

## Requirements
To run the SoaringTaskBrowser application, the following requirements must be met:

- PHP version 8.1 or higher
- MySQL database
- Optional: phpMyAdmin for database management

## Installation and Setup
Follow the steps below to install and set up the SoaringTaskBrowser application:

### Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/siglr/SoaringTaskBrowser.git`

### Set up the .env file (Copy from env.example, I might share it in the discord)
